      <p>This city provides cyberspace for all innovative and disruptive CyOperations. $CyOp will be the central currency within, running on its own DAB (decentralized autonomous blockchain) and powering the MetaGrid.</p><p />

      <p>One day, it might push its boundaries out of cyberspace and into the real world with a physical MetaGrid iteration.</p>
